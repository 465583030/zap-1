# Bolt

**We are a WIP and are just getting started.**

Bolt is a Command Line Interface (CLI) for creating new projects as fast as a lightning bolt.

<!-- We also have a GUI for you to take advantage of. You can learn more <a href="https://github.com/boltstack/bolt-gui">here.</a> -->

Both projects are currently under heavy and active development, so please be patient. We'll let you know when we are in Alpha!

### Getting Started

Right now, there's literally no code. We'll write a formal "Getting Started" section when we are approaching our first Alpha release.

### Documentation

Well, that'll come eventually. Have to develop the product first!

### Community

We value a strong community, and as such, communication is right at the top. Join us on <a href="#">Slack</a> and say hi!


### Contributing

Want to help out? No task is too small for us. If you aren't comfortable with Go, you can add to our documentation. If you want to contribute to the codebase, we would also definitely appreciate it. If you'd like to become a collaborator, please email us at <a href="#">collab@boltstack.io</a>
