# Zap

**We are a WIP and are just getting started.**

Zap is a Command Line Interface (CLI) for creating new projects.

In the future, we will also ship a GUI with the same capabilities.

Both projects are currently under heavy and active development, so please be patient. We'll let you know when we are in Alpha!

### Getting Started

We'll write a formal "Getting Started" section when we are approaching our first Alpha release.

### Documentation

Well, that'll come eventually. Have to develop the product first!

### Community
